If you’re using Python 2.7, install Pygame using the package manager.
Open a terminal window and run the following command, which will
download and install Pygame onto your system:

$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame

If you’re running Python 3, two steps are required: installing the libraries
Pygame depends on, and downloading and installing Pygame.
Enter the following to install the libraries Pygame needs. (If you use
a command such as python3.5 on your system, replace python3-dev with
python3.5-dev .)
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev mercurial
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
This will install the libraries needed to run Alien Invasion successfully.
If you want to enable some more advanced functionality in Pygame, such as
the ability to add sounds, you can also add the following libraries:
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libportmidi-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libswscale-dev libsmpeg-dev libavformat-dev libavcode-dev
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy
Now install Pygame by entering the following (use pip3 if that’s appro-
priate for your system):
$ pip install --user hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame
The output will pause for a moment after informing you which libraries
Pygame found. Press enter , even though some libraries are missing. You
should see a message stating that Pygame installed successfully.
To confirm the installation, run a Python terminal session and try to
import Pygame by entering the following:
$ python3
>>> import pygame
>>>
