#9-3. Users: Make a class called User . Create two attributes called first_name
#and last_name , and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
#in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary
#of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
#a personalized greeting to the user.
#Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods

#9-5. Login Attempts: Add an attribute called login_attempts to your User
#class from Exercise 9-3 (page 166). Write a method called increment_
#login_attempts() that increments the value of login_attempts by 1. Write
#another method called reset_login_attempts() that resets the value of login_
#attempts to 0.
#Make an instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts()
#several times. Print the value of login_attempts to make sure it was incremented
#properly, and then call reset_login_attempts() . Print login_attempts again to
#make sure it was reset to 0.
