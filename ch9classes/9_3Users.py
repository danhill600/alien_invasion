#9-3. Users: Make a class called User . Create two attributes called first_name
#and last_name , and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
#in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary
#of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
#a personalized greeting to the user.
#Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods
