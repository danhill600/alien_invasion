#9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant . The __init__() method for
#Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type .
#Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of
#information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indi-
#cating that the restaurant is open.
#Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attri-
#butes individually, and then call both methods.

#9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166).
#Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an
#instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the
#restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.
#Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
#of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and
#print the value again.
#Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
#the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any num-
#ber you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a
#day of business.
