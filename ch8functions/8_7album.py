#8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
#describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
#album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of
#information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
#albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the
#album information correctly.
#Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
#number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the num-
#ber of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least one new
#function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
